This repo contains code in support of the manuscript, "Metabolic Network Analysis and Metatranscriptomics Reveals Auxotrophies and Nutrient Sources of a Cosmopolitan Freshwater Microbial Lineage." It relies on the reverseEcology Python package, developed for this project. The package is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reverseEcology).
