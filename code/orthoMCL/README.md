Overview
---
This document describes how to use OrthoMCL to construct a set of orthologs from a set of genomes. For more on OrthoMCL, consult the original [publication](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/9/2178.full).

Prerequisites
---
* [OrthoMCL](http://www.OrthoMCL.org/OrthoMCL/) - Software for finding orthologs.
* [blastp](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/) - Called by OrthoMCL to identify candidate orthologs.
* [mcl](http://micans.org/mcl/) - Called by OrthoMCL to cluster genes into ortholog groups.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Used by OrthoMCL to store the data.

As of 2016-02-11, all of this software is installed on Zissou. Should you need to reinstall it, the following links may be helpful

* The [published protocol](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471250953.bi0612s35/full) for installing and running OrthoMCL
* [Biostars tutorial](https://www.biostars.org/p/120773/) for installing OrthoMCL
* [Github tutorial](https://github.com/apetkau/OrthoMCL-pipeline/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for installing OrthoMCL

Getting Started
---

The initial folder structure should look like the following.

    ├── README.md               # This document
    ├── genomes                 # Folder containing genomes
    │   ├── faa                 # Folder containing individual proteomes in fasta amino acid format
    ├── OrthoMCL.config         # Configuration file for OrthoMCL
    ├── scripts                 # Folder containing script to run this workflow
    │   ├── 01faaParser.py      # Converts faa files to an OrthoMCL compatabile format
    │   ├── 02parallelBlast.py  # Runs the all-vs-all BLAST job in parallel
    │   ├── 03setupMySql.sh     # Prepare the MySQL DB for use with OrthoMCL
    │   ├── 04runOrthoMCL.sh    # Run OrthoMCL
    │   ├── 05parseCOGs.sh      # Parse OrthoMCL output to generate summaries of the genes and annotations associated with each COG
    │   └── taxonMapping.txt    # File containing a linkage between your fasta file names and OrthoMCL-compliant four-letter codes

You will need to create the `genomes\faa` folder and `taxonMapping.txt` files as follows:

* `genomes\faa` - This folder should contain a proteome file for each of your genomes. Files should called `genome.fasta`. Fasta headers should be of the format:

        >genome locusTag product

in order to be compatabile with later scripts.

* `taxonMapping.txt` - OrthoMCL requires all proteomes to be named xxxx.fasta, where xxxx is a unique four-letter code. The file `taxonMapping.txt` should be a tab-separated file giving a unique code for each fasta file, where the first column is `genome` and the second column is the code. For example:

        AAA023D18	nokf
        AAA023J06	vaue

Workflow
---

The workflow consists of four scripts, summarized below.

* `01faaParser.py` - This file converts the fasta files in `genomes\faa` to a OrthoMCL-compliant format. The results are stored in `genomes\compliant`. Also creates a single file `genomes\good.fasta` for the all-vs-all BLAST job.

* `02parallelBlast.py` - This file runs the all-vs-all BLAST on multiple processors by splitting the all-vs- all job into multiple some-vs-all jobs. Users can specify the number of processors (`numCores`) and number of sequences in each some-vs-all job (`jobSize`). Also creates the BLAST database `blast\proteins.db` and aggregates the BLAST results into `blast\all-vs-all.tsv`.

* `03setupMySql.sh` - Prepares the MySQL database for use with OrthoMCL.

* `04runOrthoMCL.sh` - Runs OrthoMCL. Results are stored in the `results` folder.

They are configured to be run from the `scripts` folder.

Final Folder Structure

When the workflow is complete, your directory should look as follows:
