## Single-Cell Genome Generation, Selection, and Sequencing

Single-cell genomes were collected from the top of the water column (depth <1m) from each of two lakes, Mendota (Madison, WI, USA) and Damariscotta (Lincoln County, ME USA), in 2009. Samples were cryopreserved and sent to the Single Cell Genomics Center at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences for sorting, as previously described [@Martinez-Garcia2012, @Garcia2013]. Partial 16S rRNA genes amplified previously [@Martinez-Garcia2012] were phylogenetically classified using a controlled nomenclature for freshwater bacteria [@Newton2011a] by insertion into references trees created in the ARB software package [@Ludwig2004].

Actinobacterial SAGs used in this study were then sent to the JGI for sequencing and assembly, also as previously described [@Ghylin2014]. Briefly, shotgun libraries were constructed for each of the SAGs from re-amplified MDA products and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000. All general aspects of and detailed protocols for library construction and sequencing can be found on the JGI website (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/).

For assembly, raw sequence data was first passed through a filtering program developed at JGI to eliminate known sequencing and library preparation artifacts. Assembly was then performed using Velvet [@Zerbino2008 and ALLPATHS-LG [@Butler2008]. Additional details of the assembly process have been previously described [@Ghylin2014] and are available through the JGI Genome Portal (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov) Genome sequences are available through IMG (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/mer/main.cgi). Genome-specific information can be accessed in both databases by searching for the IMG Taxon OIDs given in Table 1.

## Metagenome Sampling, Sequencing, Assembly, and Binning

Sample collection, DNA sequencing, metabgenomic assembly, and genomic binning for the Trout Bog samples have been described previously [@Bendall2016], and similar procedures were followed for Lake Mendota samples. A summary is provided here.

For Lake Mendota, depth-integrated water samples were collected from the top 12 meters at 96 time points during ice-free periods from 2008 to 2011. For Trout Bog, depth-integrated water samples were collected from the epilimnion (44 samples) and hypolimnion (45 samples) layers during ice-free periods from 2007 to 2009. All samples were filtered on 0.2 μm polyethersulfone filters (Supor, Pall Corp) prior to storage at -80°C, as described previously [@Bendall2016]. DNA was extracted from these filters using the FastDNA kit (MP Biomedicals) and sent to the JGI for sequencing, as described previously [@Bendall2016].

Shotgun libraries were constructed for each of the samples and sequenced on an Illumina GA IIx (four Trout Bog samples) or an Illumina HiSeq2000 (all other samples), following a 2x150 indexed run recipe as previously described [@Bendall2016]. All general aspects of and detailed protocols for library construction and sequencing can be found on the JGI website (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/). Metagenomic sequence reads are publicly available on the JGI Genome Portal (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/) under Proposal ID 394.

Raw sequence data was passed through a filtering program developed at JGI to eliminate known sequencing and library preparation artifacts. Prior to assembly, reads were merged with FLASH [@Magoc2011], as previously described [@Bendall2016]. Merged reads were pooled by lake and layer into three co-assemblies using SOAPdenovo [@Luo2012a], and contigs from the resulting assemblies were assembled into a final assembly using Minimus [@Sommer2007], as previously described [@Bendall2016]. Additional details of the assembly process and metagenomic sequence reads are available through the JGI Genome Portal (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov) under Proposal ID 394.

Genomes were binned from each metagenomic co-assembly using MetaBat [@Kang2015], as described previously [@Bendall2016]. Briefly, contigs were classified into bins using tetranucleotide frequency and coverage patterns across the time-series and then manually curated, as previously described [@Bendall2016]. Genome sequences are available through IMG (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/mer/main.cgi) by searching for the IMG Taxon OIDs given in Table 1. Genomes were classified using taxonomic assignments from a set of 37 highly-conserved single-copy marker genes using Phylosift [@Darling2014], as previously described [@Bendall2016]. Final bin size and number of contigs are reported in Table 1.

## Metatranscriptome Sampling and Sequencing

Four samples were collected from the top of the water column (depth <1m) from Lake Mendota (Madison, WI, USA) over a twenty-four hour period on August 20 and 21, 2015. For each sample, between 200 and 400 mL lake water was filtered onto a 0.2 μm polyethersulfone filter (Supor, Pall Corp) and stored at -80°C until extraction.

Prior to extraction, three samples were spiked with an internal standard to enable quantification of total transcript abundance, following an established protocol [@Satinsky2014a]. Briefly, a 970-nucleotide-long mRNA standard was synthesized using a a T7 RNA polymerase and the Riboprobe In Vitro Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A fixed quantity of each standard (1.172 x 10^10 copies) was added independently to each lysis tube immediately prior to the addition of the sample filter.

Samples were subject to TRIzol-based RNA extraction (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) followed by on-column DNAse digestion and RNA purification using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). RNA was then sent to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center (https://www.biotech.wisc.edu) for sequencing. There, samples were prepared for sequencing using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), with the addition of a step for selective ribosomal RNA depletion using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Bacteria) (Illumina). The resulting cDNA libraries were pooled in an equimolar ratio, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500.

Raw paired-end reads were then merged using FLASH [@Magoc2011] using default parameters. Finally, additional rRNA and ncRNA sequences were removed using SortMeRNA [@Kopylova2012] using default parameters. SortMeRNA was run using eight built-in databases for bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic small and large ribosomal subunits and ncRNAs, derived from the SILVA 119 [@Quast2013] and RFAM [@Nawrocki2015] databases.

Additional information, including all protocols and scripts for RNA analysis, can be found on Github (https://github.com/McMahonLab/OMD-TOILv2). Raw RNA sequences can be found on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website under BioProject PRJNA######.
